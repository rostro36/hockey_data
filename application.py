This plot shows the roster cap (not in IR, LTIR, "non-roster", taxi squad and no dead cap)
of different teams and the average of divisions, conferences and the whole league as listed on
[CapFriendly](https://www.capfriendly.com/) in USD.

This view compares the amount of money spent in different salary brackets.
So if there are five million $ spent in the one million $ bracket,
this implies that there are five players making around one million $ each.

This gives interesting insights where money is spent for one team: rather the depth or the top?

Also a comparison between teams can yield interesting results.
